#   SW-ACD Decal Sorting Script
#
#   1. Importing Libraries
#       The script starts by importing several libraries:
#           os for interacting with the operating system (e.g., file paths).
#           cv2 from OpenCV for image processing.
#           numpy for numerical operations.
#           PIL.Image from the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for handling image operations.
#           collections.Counter for counting elements in lists.
#           tkinter for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
#   2. Brightness Calculation Function
#           calculate_brightness(pixel):
#               This function calculates the brightness of a pixel using a weighted average formula based on the RGB values, reflecting the human eyeâ€™s sensitivity to different colors.
#   3. Brightness Analysis
#           analyze_brightness(image):
#               The function converts the image to a list of brightness levels for all pixels.
#               It then counts how often each brightness level occurs and identifies the two most common brightness levels in the image.
#   4. Transparency Analysis
#           analyze_transparency(image):
#               This function extracts the alpha (transparency) channel from the image and analyzes the transparency levels.
#               It counts the occurrences of each transparency level and identifies the two most common levels, converting them into percentages.
#   5. Shape Classification
#       Helper Functions:
#           is_rectangle(contour) checks if a contour has four sides, indicating it is a rectangle.
#           is_diagonal(contour) checks if a contour forms a diagonal shape based on its angle.
#           is_curve(contour) checks if a contour is curved by analyzing its convex hull.
#           classify_shape(image):
#               This function classifies the main shape in the image by examining the contours (outlines) detected in the image.
#               Depending on the detected shape, it categorizes the image into one of three categories: "sw_r" (rectangle), "sw_d" (diagonal), or "sw_c" (curve).
#   6. Grayscale Check
#           is_grayscale(image):
#               This function checks whether an image is grayscale by comparing the RGB channels. If all channels are equal, the image is grayscale.
#   7. Folder Processing Decision
#           should_process_folder(folder_name):
#               This function determines whether a folder should be processed. It skips folders starting with digits or specific prefixes like "sw_d", "sw_r", or "sw_c".
#   8. Main Image Processing
#           process_images(directory, mode, include_subfolders, ignore_color):
#               This is the core function that processes the images in a selected directory:
#               It walks through the directory and processes each image based on the selected mode (brightness, transparency, or shapes).
#           Brightness Mode: Images are sorted into folders based on the two most common brightness levels.
#           Transparency Mode: Images are sorted based on the two most common transparency levels.
#           Shapes Mode: Images are categorized into shape-based folders (sw_r, sw_d, sw_c).
#
#           If ignore_color is selected, non-grayscale images are skipped during processing.
#           If include_subfolders is disabled, only the main folder is processed.
#   9. GUI Setup
#           select_folder_and_mode():
#               This function opens a file dialog for the user to select a directory and initiates the image processing based on the selected mode and options.
#           The GUI (tkinter) includes:
#               Radio buttons for selecting the sorting mode (brightness, transparency, or shapes).
#               Checkboxes to include subfolders and ignore non-grayscale images.
#               A button to select the folder and start processing.
#   10. Main Execution
#           The script concludes with the root.mainloop() which keeps the GUI running, allowing users to interact with the interface and trigger image processing based on their selections.
#           Overall, this script allows the user to sort a collection of images into folders based on brightness, transparency, or basic shape categories using a simple graphical interface.
